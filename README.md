Classify mobile application

I am a student, I am busy with classes, and I am ready to be organized!

Increased stress in students invites more problems to arise such as drug and alcohol problems, lower grades and more. The ever-so-present link between organization and mental health is something that affects everyone every day; as organization improves, as does your mental health. Due to the recent rise in stress-related mental health issues in university students, we decided to create an app that reduces stress and makes life easier. What you do is difficult. Why not make how you organize it easier? That is why we created Classify. Classify is your go-to organizational app. It is unlike any other organizational app on the market due to its unique purpose of addressing the multiple factors surrounding stress: encouraging healthy lifestyle, organization and time management. Classify is an app made by students for students.
